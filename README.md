A C# ASP.NET MVC web application I wrote with the help of online Youtube tutorials. 
The application allows you to track personal expenses and incomes via category, and display financial metrics on the main dashboard.

System features:

-Syncfusion SDK for clean UI and data visualization  
-SQLite database for lightweight hosting solutions  
-Custom emoji keyboard for categories  
-Hosted online through Azure Web Services

Online version is available to test here: [https://bit.ly/3En3SIs](https://bit.ly/42KXL97)
